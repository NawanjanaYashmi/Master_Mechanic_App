# Master_Mechanic_App



<h3>Introduction</h3>



"Motor Mechanic" is a vehicle service station app focused on the Sri Lankan community that connects customers directly. The primary purpose of this is to provide an efficient service to its customers. In this way, the customers who come to get the services must first create an account by entering their details, and then they can get the related services more quickly. Many services are provided to customers. They will be given the opportunity to repair and wash their vehicles, check the spare parts related to the vehicles, and buy them. The admin adds all the details about vehicle parts, including the prices, which the customers can see. For that, they can complete all the details about their vehicle by filling out the registration form. Also, the QR code of the related vehicles can be added to this app; therefore, it is easy to manage all the vehicles in the service station. In addition to this, a special advantage for customers registering their vehicles here is that if their vehicle breaks down on the road, the staff here will send relevant employees to the location of their customers to help them. In order to do that, this app shows a vehicle breakdown form for contacting their customers in those situations. So customers connect with them by filling it out. While carrying out a vehicle repair, the vehicle repairer and the associated employees provide all the information related to the repair to their customers and maintain constant contact with the customers.
